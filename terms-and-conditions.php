This dynamic one time password identifies the Card increases security or eliminates the need for username and password for the following operations:</li>
                            <li>(a) Activation of your Wega Account upon receipt of the Card via the applicable mobile app. This will at the same time trigger the activation of your Account for usage of the Card as a payment method.</li>

                            <li>4.2.3 The Wega Chip is powered by a lithium battery. The functional battery life should under normal conditions extend beyond the expiration date of the Card.</li>
                            <li>4.2.4 Your Wega Chip is manufactured to function well beyond the expiration of the Card assuming reasonable use. However, if the Wega Chip does not produce a sound frequency by pushing the X in the bottom left corner of the Card prior to activation or during the life of the Card please let us know via email at <a href="mailto:support@wegamc.com">support@wegamc.com</a> from the email address registered with your Card, send us the Card to Wega Support, 61 Praed Street, Suite 31, London W2 1NS and upon receipt of the Card we will immediately replace the Card free of charge.

                            <li>5.1. Your use of the Card is subject to our verification of your Personal Details (i.e. KYC) by either electronic verification means and/or requesting relevant KYC information or documents from you as applicable.</li>
                            <li>5.2. When entering into Transactions over the internet, some websites may require you to enter your Personal Details and in such instances you should supply the most recent Personal Details that you have provided us with.</li>
                            <li>5.3. You must notify us of any change in your Personal Details as soon as possible by contacting Customer Services or updating the details in your Mobile App Account or Online Account. You will be liable for any loss that directly results from any failure to notify us of a change in your Personal Details due to undue delay, your gross negligence or fraud. We will need to verify your new Personal Details and may request relevant KYC information/documents from you as applicable.</li>
                            <li>5.4. We reserve the right at any time to satisfy ourselves as to your Personal Details (for example, by requesting relevant original documents) including for the purposes of preventing fraud and/or money laundering. In addition, at the time of your application or at any time in the future, in connection with your Account, you authorise us to undertake electronic identity verification checks on you either directly or using relevant third parties.</li>
                        </ol>

                        <strong>6. Loading your Card</strong>
                        <ol class="point">
                            <li>6.1. Funds may be added to your Account by any of the permitted methods set out in the “Loading Fees” section of the Fees and Limits Schedule.</li>
                            <li>6.2. To load your card by debit card, you must use a debit card that has been issued by a regulated financial institution in the EEA and is registered at the same name and address as your Card.</li>
                            <li>6.3. Only the Primary Cardholder and not the holders of any Additional Cards may add Funds to your Account.</li>
                            <li>6.4. Fund loading limits vary according to the type of Card and these are set out in the Fees & Limits Schedule.</li>
                            <li>6.5. If enabled, you will have the option to transfer your Available Balance or part balance from your Card or Account to other Accounts that may be held with us (i.e. a “Card-to-Card” transfer). If you instruct us to make a transfer from your Account to another person’s Account, the requested amount will be debited from your Account and credited to the Account in accordance with your instructions. You may incur a Card-to-Card Transfer Fee for this Transaction.</li>
                        </ol>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>7. Using your Card</strong>
                        <ol class="point">
                            <li>7.1. Your use of the Card is subject to the applicable Fees detailed in the Fees & Limits Schedule, which shall be deducted from the Available Balance.</li>
                            <li>7.2. You can use the Card at any Merchant who accepts the applicable Scheme to (where permitted by your Card-type) make purchases in-store, via the internet or over the phone and to withdraw cash from ATMs and banks who agree to provide this service (subject to any additional fees that such ATM operators or banks may charge), unless we inform you otherwise.</li>
                            <li>7.3. You must always ensure that you have sufficient Available Balance for each Transaction you authorise (including value added tax and other taxes, duties and applicable fees). If the Available Balance is insufficient to pay for a Transaction, some Merchants may not permit you to combine the use of your Card with other payment methods.</li>
                            <li>7.4. If for any reason a Transaction is carried out but its amount exceeds the Available Balance, you must pay us the deficit immediately, and if you fail to do so after receiving an email notification from us, we reserve the right to take all necessary steps, including legal action, to recover this deficit.</li>
                            <li>7.5. There are certain circumstances where a Merchant may require you to have an Available Balance greater than the value of the Transaction you wish to make. You will only be charged for the actual and final value of the Transaction you make. Merchants request this, as they may need to access more funds than you initially planned to spend for example, when making hotel or rental car reservations. In the event that a Merchant has prior authorization on your Card, you will not have access to the relevant funds until the Transaction is completed or, if sooner, up to a period of 30 days.</li>
                            <li>7.6. Your Card cannot be used where such Merchants are unable to obtain online authorisation that you have sufficient Available Balance for the Transaction (for example, Transactions made on trains, ships, some in-flight purchases and tollbooths. We accept no liability if a Merchant refuses to accept payment using the Card.</li>
                            <li>7.7. You must not use the Card for:
                                <ul class="point">
                                    <li>pre-authorised regular payments; or</li>
                                    <li>Transactions at self-service petrol pumps;</li>
                                    <li>any illegal purposes.</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                        </ol>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>8. Authorising Transactions</strong>
                        <ol class="point">
                            <li>8.1 You will need to authorise each Transaction so that we can check it is genuine by, where applicable, submitting or using your PIN or other security code personal to you and/or your Card (for example, by using 3D Secure).  For the avoidance of doubt, any Transaction you authorise using 3D Secure shall be automatically considered a Transaction which you have authorised.</li>
                            <li>8.2. The time of receipt of a Transaction order is when we receive it. If a Transaction order is received after 4pm on a Business Day then it will be deemed to have been received on the next Business day.</li>
                            <li>8.3. Once a Transaction has been authorised by you, it cannot be revoked. Within the EEA, we shall ensure the cash transfer to the Merchant’s payment service provider within 4 Business Days following the day on which the Transaction order is received.  This condition 7.3 only applies if a Merchant’s payment service provider is located within the EEA and the payment services being carried out are in the currency of an EEA Member State.</li>
                            <li>8.4. Your ability to use or access the Card may occasionally be interrupted, for example if we need to carry out maintenance on our systems or websites. Please contact Customer Services to notify us of any problems you are experiencing using your Card or Account and we will endeavour to resolve as soon as possible.</li>
                        </ol>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>9. Additional Cards</strong>
                        <ol class="point">
                            <li>9.1. At our sole discretion and provided you have provided sufficient KYC information/documents (in accordance with condition 5.3), you may be eligible to apply for up to 3 Additional Cards connected directly to your Account, for use by Additional Cardholders by contacting Customer Services or accessing the relevant area in your Mobile App account or Online Account.</li>
                            <li>9.2. Additional Cardholders must be at least 18 years old or, provided that you are legally responsible for them, at least 13 years old.  Transactions by persons under 18 years of age may not be allowed by some Merchants but in all cases, you shall be responsible for any use of any Additional Cards. We may request KYC for each Additional Cardholder as required.</li>
                            <li>9.3. The use of Additional Cards is always subject to the validity of the related Primary Card: Additional Cards may not be used if the related Primary Card has expired.</li>
                            <li>9.4. If your Additional Card application is successful, we will send you an Additional Card, which will be subject to a Fee and which you may give to the nominated Additional Cardholder for their exclusive use, provided that:
                                <ol class="point lower-roman">
                                    <li>you provide the Additional Cardholder with a copy of these terms and conditions (which will then bind use by both of you);</li>
                                    <li>the Additional Card is used only by that Additional Cardholder; </li>
                                    <li>you retain the Primary Card for your sole and exclusive use in accordance with this Agreement;</li>
                                    <li>all Transactions made on the Additional Card shall be considered as having been authorised directly by the Primary Cardholder, who shall be responsible for such Transactions and any applicable Fees.</li>
                                </ol>
                            </li>
                            <li>9.5. Funds cannot be loaded directly on to Additional Cards, which will be connected to the same Account as the Primary Card.  Only Primary Cardholders may load Additional Cards and they can do so by transferring funds from their Account.</li>
                            <li>9.6. You must ensure that any Additional Cardholders under 18 years of age do not use a Card for any purpose for which the minimum age is at least 18 e.g. purchase of alcohol, adult entertainment or gambling.</li>
                        </ol>
                    </li>

                        <ol class="point">
                            <li>10.1. Following Card activation, we shall send you a PIN for use with your Physical Card by notifying you in your Mobile App Account or Online Account.  You will need this PIN in order to authorise certain Transactions.</li>
                            <li>10.2. If you forget your PIN, you can retrieve it by accessing your Mobile App Account or Online Account.</li>
                            <li>10.3. When ordering a Primary Card on the Website, you will be prompted to create a Username and Password. You will need this Username and Password to access your Online Account and perform the following functions (as well as any other functions specified in the Website) in relation to your Card online:
                                <ol class="point lower-roman">

                                    <li>check your Transaction details; and</li>

                            <li>10.4. We recommend that you check your Online Account and Transaction history on a regular basis as they are updated continuously.</li>
                            <li>10.5. Other than in relation to an Additional Cardholder, you must not give your Card to any other person or allow any other person to use it. You are responsible for your Card, PIN, Online Account and any related security details and must take all reasonable measures to keep them safe and entirely confidential.</li>
                            <li>10.6. You are responsible for your Account, Card, PIN, Mobile App Account, Online Account and any related security details and must take all possible measures to keep them safe and entirely confidential.  Such measures include:
                                <ol class="point lower-roman">

                                    <li>keeping your PIN secret at all times for example, by not using your PIN if anyone else is watching;</li>
                                    <li>not disclosing your PIN to any person, except that you may disclose the PIN orally (but not in writing) to an Additional Cardholder.</li>

                            <li>10.7. Failure to comply with this condition 9 may affect your ability to claim any losses in the event that we can show that you have intentionally failed to keep the information safe or you have acted fraudulently, with undue delay or with gross negligence. In all other circumstances, your maximum liability shall be as set out below at condition 13.</li>
                            <li>10.8. If you believe that someone else knows your Online Account, PIN or Card security details, you must contact Customer Services immediately. </li>
                            <li>10.9. Once your Card has expired or if it is found after you have reported it as lost or stolen you must destroy it by cutting it in two through the magnetic strip and the EMV chip</li>

                        <ol class="point">
                            <li>14.1. You are responsible for protecting your Card as if it were cash in your wallet – if it is lost or stolen, you may lose some or all of the money on your Card. In the same way as if you lost your wallet unless you contact us as specified in this condition.</li>
                            <li>14.2. You must contact us immediately by calling Customer Service if you know or suspect that a Card is lost or stolen or that the PIN or any Card related security details is known to an unauthorised person or you think a Transaction has been incorrectly executed.</li>
                            <li>14.3. You shall be liable for up to a maximum of €150 of losses due to unauthorised Transactions made before you informed us about the theft or loss of the Card. If our investigations reveal that you authorised a disputed Transaction or that you acted fraudulently or negligently (for example, by not keeping your Card or PIN safe), you may be liable for any loss we suffer due to use of the Card.</li> 
                            <li>14.4. Once a loss, theft or unauthorised use of your Card is reported, use of the Card shall be blocked to avoid further losses.</li>
                            <li>14.5. Replacement Cards will be sent to the most recent address you have provided and will be subject to a Fee.</li>
                            <li>14.6. You agree to cooperate with our agents, any supervisory authority, the police and us if your Card is lost, stolen or if we suspect fraudulent use of the Card.</li>
                            <li>14.7. We will refund the amount of any unauthorised or incorrectly executed Transaction immediately unless we have any reason to believe that the incident may have been caused by a breach of this Agreement, through gross negligence or we have reasonable grounds to suspect fraud.</li>
                        </ol>

                    <li><strong>15. Payment Disputes</strong>
                        <ol class="point">
                            <li>15.1. If you dispute a Transaction that you have authorised and which has been processed on your Card, you should settle this with the person you bought the goods or services from; we are not responsible for the quality, safety, legality or any other aspect of goods or services purchased with your Card.</li>
                            <li>15.2. If your dispute with a Merchant relating to a Transaction cannot be resolved you should contact us at Customer Services, and we will attempt to assist you as far as is reasonably practicable and may charge you a chargeback-processing Fee.</li>
                            <li>15.3. If you have reason to believe that a Transaction for which your Card was used was unauthorised or allocated to your Account in error, you may ask us to investigate the Transaction.  If we investigate the Transaction, the disputed amount will be unavailable to spend until our investigation is complete and if we receive information that proves the Transaction was genuine, this will be deducted from your Available Balance and we may charge you an investigation Fee. If you do not have sufficient Available Balance, you must repay us the amount immediately on demand.</li>
                        </ol>

                    <li><strong>16. Foreign Exchange</strong>

                            <li>16.1. If you use your Card in a currency other than the currency in which your Card is denominated, the amount deducted from your Available Balance will be the amount of the Transaction converted to your Account currency using a rate set by the Scheme on the date the Transaction is processed.  Exchange rates can fluctuate and they may change between the time a Transaction is made and the time it is deducted from your Available Balance. You may also be charged a foreign exchange Fee as set out in the Fees & Limits Schedule.</li>
                            <li>16.2. Please refer to the following Scheme websites (as applicable) for more information on the applicable exchange rates: <a href="https://www.mastercard.com/global/currencyconversion/index.html">www.mastercard.com</a></li>

                            <li>17.5. Nothing in this Agreement shall exclude or limit our liability for death or personal injury resulting from our negligence or fraud.</li>
